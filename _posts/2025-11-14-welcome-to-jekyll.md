This is your first blog post with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. It's perfect for GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

You can write posts in Markdown format. Just create new files in the `_posts` directory with the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

### Features

- **Markdown support** - Write in simple Markdown
- **Liquid templating** - Powerful template engine
- **GitHub Pages integration** - Deploy with a simple git push
- **Fast and secure** - Static files, no database
